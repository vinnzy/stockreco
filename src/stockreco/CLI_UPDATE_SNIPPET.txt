In src/stockreco/cli.py inside recommend(), replace:

    agent_out = run_agents(scored, as_of=asof_str, use_llm=use_llm)
    write_markdown(md_path, target_date, asof_str, agent_out, scored)

with:

    agent_out = run_agents(scored, as_of=asof_str, use_llm=use_llm)
    scored_for_report = agent_out.get("scored", scored)
    write_markdown(md_path, target_date, asof_str, agent_out, scored_for_report)

Also, if you build out_json['top15'] from scored, switch to scored_for_report.
